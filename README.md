#INTRODUCTION 
The online bike rental system is a web-based platform that allows bike owners to register as sellers and list their bikes for rent.
It also enables customers to register and rent bikes from sellers.
The system includes modules for bikes, login/registration, admin, users, payments, and adding/removing staff. The main reasons for developing the system are to enhance the bike rental business processes, allow online reservations and registration, and enable group bookings. 
The primary aim is to create a web-based system for customers to reserve and rent bikes online and for companies to manage their business more effectively.
